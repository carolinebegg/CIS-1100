I had some trouble with trying to use variables that had only been declared
inside a loop, and also with summing the forces. I didn't even realize at 
first that these two problems were related, but going to office hours really 
helped me figure out the issues with my code and really helped clarify what I 
needed to do. UPDATE: I ran into a lot of trouble because all of my values were
slight off, even though my simulation ran correctly. I had to take a late day and 
went to office hours again, and it was very helpful. I had an issue with when I 
had declared the updates to my position variables inside of the wrong loop, and
needed to take them out of that loop and put them in their own for loop.
