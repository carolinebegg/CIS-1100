I did find this homework very helpful. I unfortunately was not able to dedicate 
quit the time that I would have liked to to this assignment which would have helped
further my learning, but even so, it was very helpful.

UPDATE: After working through the entire project, I do feel that this assignment has
really helped cement my understanding of object oriented programming. Implementing 
the various target objects and bird object helped me better understand what an 
object is and how it works.

I have been very sick this week, and have not been able to dedicate sufficient 
focused time to this assignment; I had a terrible migraine on Monday evening, and 
on Tuesday I had a bad bout of nausea that lasted the entire day. Between these two
unfortunately timed occurrences, I was not able to devote as much time to this
assignment as I would have liked. I also unfortunately have already used all of my 
late days.

UPDATE: I emailed Professor Harry and Professor Eric about not feeling well this
week, and they granted me a one-day extension on this assignment, which is why I am
resubmitting today. Having had some more time to work on it, I feel that I was able
to work through more of the major issues, which included being confused on the 
isHit() and setHitThisShot() functions, which I worked through in office hours with
the help of a TA.

Target Color: the targets are updated so that they are red and white bullseyes; uses
concentric red and white circles

Target Size After Being Hit: every time a target is hit, the size of the target is 
reduced by 25%. This is done by calling the decreaseRadius() function within the 
arena.update() function, which is a helper function that I wrote that assigns the 
value of the radius to radius * 0.75 when it is called.
