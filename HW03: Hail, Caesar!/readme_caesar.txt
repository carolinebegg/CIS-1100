I really struggling with the timing on this project. I started it over the weekend 
and worked on during the week and went to office hours, but was still having a tough
time with it. This was further complicated by fall break, as I traveled 
internationally on Wednesday evening and have a 5 hour time difference. At the 
beginning, it was more that I was just confused in general and having a hard 
time understanding the project. Because of this, I went through and did a very close
read of the write-up. My issue was then that although I conceptually knew what
needed to be done in the code, I was having a difficult time implementing this. 
However, I do feel like I have learned a lot from this assignment. Further, I made
sure to include a bunch of comments in my code for my own learning purpose, as it is
very helpful for me to have a step-by-step record for the future of the purpose 
of each function (and sometimes specific lines within the function). I also really 
utilized Ed, both by asking my own questions and by reading the questions
and answers of other students. As I got towards the end of the project, the main 
issue I ran into is that my key was off by 3. However, I posted a question in Ed and
got a very helpful response from a TA, which said that I probably had been wrapping 
all of the shifts and unshifts, not just the ones that needed to be wrapped. My code 
was working very well, but I accidentally did something that I am currently unable 
to identify and now none of the crack functions are working at all how they are 
supposed to.

**********************************************************************
 *  What are the benefits of using functions?                   
**********************************************************************

You can make your code easier to read and easier to debug by creating
functions and then calling them whenever you want to use them, rather
than by actually rewriting a bunch of lines of code.

**********************************************************************
 *  What are any flaws you can come up with regarding the use of a
 *  Caesar Cipher to store sensitive data?                 
**********************************************************************

If you have enough computing power, it can be relatively easily
cracked with brute force attack.

**********************************************************************
 *  Encrypt the following message with a key value of G, write the 
 *  output below:
 *  "No one is so brave that he is not disturbed by something 
 *	unexpected"
**********************************************************************

TU UTK OY YU HXGBK ZNGZ NK OY TUZ JOYZAXHKJ HE YUSKZNOTM ATKDVKIZKJ

**********************************************************************
 *  Crack encrypted_message and output the first line of the 
    decrypted message below
**********************************************************************
 
 LET US GO THEN, YOU AND I,

 **********************************************************************
 *  Please list all help, collaboration, and outside resources
 *  you used here. 
 *
 *  If you did not get any help in outside of TA office hours,
 *  and did not use any materials outside of the standard
 *  course materials and piazza, write the following statement below:
 *  "I did not receive any help outside of TA office hours.  I
 *  did not collaborate with anyone, and I did not use any
 *  resources beyond the standard course materials."
 **********************************************************************

I did not receive any help outside of TA office hours.  I 
did not collaborate with anyone, and I did not use any 
resources beyond the standard course materials.

**********************************************************************
 *  Are you planning on re-submitting the assignment after this submission?                 
**********************************************************************

No, because I already am using two late days to submit right now.

**********************************************************************
 *  List any other comments here                   
**********************************************************************

Please read through my code, because although it won't compile now or take the 
crack function, I do think its very close. I am not sure if there is any partial 
credit available, but I would really, really appreciate if I could at least have 
some guidance on whether I am close or not.
